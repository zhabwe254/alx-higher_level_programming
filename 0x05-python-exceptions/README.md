In Python, exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception, and if it's not handled properly, the program may terminate.

Here's a brief overview of how exceptions work in Python:

Raise an Exception:
You can raise an exception using the raise statement. For example:

python
Copy code
raise ValueError("This is a custom error message")
Handle an Exception:
To handle exceptions, you use a try block to enclose the code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs, it is caught by an associated except block. For example:

python
Copy code
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    # Handle the exception
    print(f"Error: {e}")
In this example, a ZeroDivisionError is caught, and an error message is printed.

Multiple Except Blocks:
You can have multiple except blocks to catch different types of exceptions:

python
Copy code
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    value = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid conversion to int")
except TypeError:
    print("Type error occurred")
Exception Hierarchy:
Exceptions in Python are organized into a hierarchy. You can catch a more general exception or a more specific one. For example, catching Exception will catch any exception:

python
Copy code
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    value = int("abc")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
Finally Block:
The finally block is executed whether an exception is raised or not. It is often used for cleanup operations:

python
Copy code
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    print("This will always execute")
Custom Exceptions:
You can create your own custom exceptions by creating a new class that inherits from the built-in Exception class.

python
Copy code
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise CustomError("This is a custom exception")
except CustomError as e:
    print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")
These are some basics of handling exceptions in Python. Proper exception handling is essential for writing robust and reliable code.
